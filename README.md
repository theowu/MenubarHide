**MenubarHide** is a very simple **Mac OS X / macOS** application that lets you show or hide system-cached files via a little menubar icon. Simply launch application without typing long commands every time in the terminal to show or hide those annoying system files.

###Historical versions###

#version 1.0#

The **initial release** including the very basic function of hiding and showing cached files, however, it does have some problems such as:
when the cached files are already shown on the desktop, click on "show files" will cache them..., perhaps further versions will solve that...
